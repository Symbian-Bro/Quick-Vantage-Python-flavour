# Quick-Vantage-Python-flavour-
Porting Quick Vantage from shell to Python. Everyone tells me Python is better for scripting, so why not?
I will upload the functions seperately as I create them :)

Okay, here are the instructions : 

~ Run the .py file using "sudo python3 Quick-Vantage.py"
~ That's it :)
